        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/13-push-notification/ -&lt;p&gt;Now days it&amp;rsquo;s kind of defacto that every website requires some sort of mechanism to update changes dynamically. On my last project we had a specific need to keep updating the count of messages like Facebook does for unread messages. The website is a dot com site with reasonable user base online. It was challenging to come up with a solution so that we can get this developed quickly and scale well with the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed multiple approach and chose one for development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;approach-1-poll-for-changes&#34;&gt;Approach 1: Poll for changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of classical pull approach where every &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; second poll for changes and update UI. The problem with polling every 30 sec were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/13/poll.png&#34; alt=&#34;poll for changes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unnecessary extra load on the server means fake http requests, 1 will have new message out of 100+ requests. Major hurdle in scaling app, suddenly the no of requests on server will increase multiple fold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delay in data refresh based on poll frequency and it won&amp;rsquo;t be realtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t http cache the request using reverse proxy since it is user&amp;rsquo;s personal data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approach may be okay for sites like live cricket scores where requests can be http cached and served to multiple users and data changes frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;approach-2-push-for-changes&#34;&gt;Approach 2: Push for changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second approach we came up with was push messages using websockets and libraries like socket.io etc.  Using push the user experience is really awesome, user gets notified instantaneously about the new messages. No extra fake requests on the server and helps in scaling easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/13/push.png&#34; alt=&#34;push for changes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up the Notification Server. We were using Apache server and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support websocket connections. Needs upgrade to our infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing server side component for Notification Server with security and authentication was significant effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More effort as compared to poll for maintaining state logic on Notification server &amp;amp; Javascript, requires resilience in building edge cases around data loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome over challenges we though of going to PaaS for Push Notification like PubNub and Pusher. However the challenge with PaaS is data security. Is it okay to send user personal data to 3rd party? The answer in our case of NO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;approach-3-push-notification-for-changes&#34;&gt;Approach 3: Push notification for changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/13/push-notification.png&#34; alt=&#34;push notify for changes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome the problem of data security we came with the tweaked approach as shown above. We use PaaS for Push Notification only to notify end user about there is new message and no data. When the notification is received we do the poll request on main server to refresh the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key advantages of using this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No effort required for building &amp;amp; maintaining Notification Server. Leverage the PaaS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just send the change notification, so issues with data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less development effort since most of the PaaS provider has their own library to support all browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime updates to end user. Better user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High availability and scalability using PaaS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pubnub.com/&#34;&gt;PubNub&lt;/a&gt; as PaaS and experience so far is really good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Distributed team communication plan with anatomy of an iteration</title>
        <link>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/12-distributed-team-communication/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/12-distributed-team-communication/</guid>
        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/12-distributed-team-communication/ -&lt;p&gt;Agile software development is getting more and more attention now a days. One of the variations of it is called &amp;lsquo;Distributed Agile Development&amp;rsquo;. And a key ingredient for distributed teams to work effectively is &amp;ldquo;communication&amp;rdquo;. Quote from Kent Back on communication &amp;ldquo;Problems with projects can invariably be traced back to somebody not talking to somebody else about something important.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we are doing an inception with a client and their past experience with distributed team has left them with some bitterness. In addition, the client has just started adopting agile practices in their software development cycle, so along with delivery we are also doing enablement for them. Also making sure business and new team member understand the different buzzwords of agile software development is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience every team has variations in mechanics of implementing agile, keeping all the principles intact. For example, story prioritization for some teams is Iteration Planning Meeting (aka Iteration Kick Off) and  some teams go for  more lean  like method of story prioritization and adopts an iteration-less Kanban style pull mechanism. For  distributed teams, the variations are important to know and everyone should understand the why&amp;rsquo;s of it. Daily standup need to be little different when working in distributed model, Iteration showcase and iteration length varies too from team to team. In my opinion all such mechanics are decided and derived based different parameters. However, the important part is to discuss, decide and communicate  the mechanics &amp;amp;process of project&amp;rsquo;s agile development with all team members including business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And its very important to plan for some session during inception to address need around all of the above.
Taking &amp;ldquo;Story Lifecycle&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Anatomy of Iteration&amp;rdquo; our team (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/sunitparekh&#34;&gt;Sunit Parekh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/_birinder&#34;&gt;Birinder Singh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://pandafunda.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Sarbashrestha Panda&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp;Amit Dhakad) did the following session in little different settings and format. This blog is all about sharing the mechanics of running the session. I am calling it &amp;ldquo;Communication plan with anatomy of iteration lifecycle&amp;rdquo; and some of following is for the distributed team structure, where the business, SMEs, Product Owner and Product Sponsor are in UK and the development team is back in India.  Hence few of the mechanics differ from co-located team structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics to broadly cover during session are,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a story and Story lifecycle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is an iteration and Anatomy of iteration &amp;amp; lifecycle?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition of Story Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing strategy (automated and manual)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a timeline on the board to start the session with first talking about what is story and story lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/12/anatomy-of-iteration-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;communication plan empty&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we kept discussing about the iteration, we started moving story stages onto iteration lifecycle. Also started building the events as shown in the picture below. Session took an hour to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/12/distributed-team-communication.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;communication plan with iteration lifecycle&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep most of the stickies written before the session. This helps to remember all points to cover and running the session quickly. Have discussions during the session and make it as interactive as possible. As a team decides most of the stuff (e.g. definition of story done, iteration length, meetings/calls, Skype or Google Hangout) rather than dictating to others, this is very important as that makes it team&amp;rsquo;s plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things, that is different for a distributed agile team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standup&lt;/strong&gt;, can be little different format. We use mingle card wall to just talk about cards updates if there are any queries or updates, achievements of the team during day, along with any blockers and show-stoppers for team. Keep it short. 15 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BA Catchup&lt;/strong&gt;, business is busy most of the day with their job and so it is important to block SMEs calendar for certain time of the day so that can be utilized for any questions, queries and demo&amp;rsquo;s for feedback. Daily 1 hr. We do it just followed by distributed team standup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;, continuous process like Kanban. Regularly BA Catchup call is used for story prioritization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iteration Kickoff and Iteration Showcase&lt;/strong&gt;, we like Kanban style prioritization however it is good to get everyone together and share the project status, updates and showcase key features build since last meet and what&amp;rsquo;s the plan ahead for team. We do this as one meeting scheduled at the end of iteration as iteration showcase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Huddles&lt;/strong&gt;, during initial stage of the project couple of times a week and later it&amp;rsquo;s kind of need basis once or twice a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share your comments, suggestions &amp;amp;experiences about this kind of sessions. What more we should cover, what we should watch out for&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://pandafunda.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Sarbashrestha Panda&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing the post and recommending valuable amendments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project envisioning exercise - Process Timeline Map</title>
        <link>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/11-process-timeline-map/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/11-process-timeline-map/</guid>
        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/11-process-timeline-map/ -&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges in an inception is to learn about the business processes and its workflow in a fair amount of detail in a relatively quick amount of time. The idea is, not to just learn about the client&amp;rsquo;s business processes, but also to ensure that various stakeholders within the client actually share that understanding instead of having varying ideas in their own heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of methods to study business processes but they are time consuming and heavy weight and may be not as collaborative. A classical way is to create process map diagram &amp;amp; value stream mapping. Such methods are valuable in different settings. In our context, an inception, we try to uncover information in enough detail to be able to kickstart delivery without spending loads of time and making it a formal inception phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recent inception, we (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/sunitparekh&#34;&gt;Sunit Parekh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/_birinder&#34;&gt;Birinder Singh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://pandafunda.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Sarbashrestha Panda&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp;Amit Dhakad) combined ideas from different process analysis methods and came up with this hybrid light weight approach. It is not full blown value stream mapping but this approach does have elements of it and highlights the processes that are most time consuming and potentially wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process map was built on a large canvas/wall, so that it would constantly be visible to all the participant in the inception. We started building the process map by plotting a timeline on x axis and noting different steps in the process flow on the y axis. Also, the actors/roles involved in the process were indicated for each process. A legends for denoting the actors was also put up on the wall for the ease of identification. Building this full as-is process map of the as-is process was done over multiple sessions spanning a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1&lt;/strong&gt;: After couple of session with business first cut of the as-is process timeline map looked something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/11/process-timeline-map-as-is-stage1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;process timeline map as is stage 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2&lt;/strong&gt;: After another iteration, the as-is process shaped up to something like this. It was also clearer in the client stakeholders&amp;rsquo; minds. It also had functional area clearly called out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/11/process-timeline-map-as-is.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;process timeline map as is&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantage of having large visible canvas for the current as-is model is that it provided us a reference point at all times in inception. It became one of the living document for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3&lt;/strong&gt;: We then took this forward and mapped the future to-be process on top of it by putting magic chart in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/11/process-timeline-map-to-be.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;process timeline map to be&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to superimpose the potential &amp;lsquo;to-be&amp;rsquo; process on top of the &amp;lsquo;as-is&amp;rsquo; process allowed everyone to be able to &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; how it was lighter weight in comparison. It also allowed us to ensure and double check that we were indeed covering the key activities / steps from the current process and losing / getting rid of only the non value adding ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, we digitalized above process map.  This structure / format / way of creating a process map was very well received by the business teams as well. They, in fact, suggested that the maps should be left as is in the room for anyone new to the business to use as a starting point for understanding their business processed. That feedback was indeed awesome. :) To me, this is called innovation and collaborative effort was what made it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stationary used for building such map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic Charts with Grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mulitcolor Stickies  (pink was used for timeline event/instances, yellow for activities in business process)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrow Stickies (cut sticky in arrow shape or get 3M arrow tags)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Dot Stickers (used for legends such as actors for activities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharpies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Project envisioning exercise - Product Map</title>
        <link>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/10-product-map/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/10-product-map/</guid>
        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/10-product-map/ -&lt;p&gt;One of the key factors for our project is that the client is almost 80+ yrs old in business. There are multiple products with different variations of it in the market. Now one of the task/session was to understand their product space, their groupings and how they differ from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For understanding product and its family and how they differ from each other, we (Inception team - Sunit, Amit, Panda and Birinder) came up with a simple idea of creating a &amp;ldquo;Product Map&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;: To understand the breadth and depth of the products and their variations.
&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;: 30 min to 1 hr (depends on the # of products and product families)
&lt;strong&gt;Participants&lt;/strong&gt;: SMEs and Business Stakeholders
&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;: Create large board with matrix/grid having products on rows and comparison factors as columns. Write down all the known products and comparison factors on stickies to save time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-execute&#34;&gt;How to execute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First steps to ask business to complete the product list, and then group them based similarities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rearrange product list, keep the most popular product family and product on top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss comparison factors, against which the products need to be compared or studied. Few options to consider are,
3.1 User base for the product
3.2 Process steps/work-flow the product goes through
3.3 Numbers related to product, such as revenue, time factors etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with most popular product first and considering it as the base, discuss the variations in other products in the same family. Put notes on small stickies for each variation discovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/10/product-map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;product map&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;variation&#34;&gt;Variation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can be used for technical debt matrix e.g. put different modules/areas of codebase as rows, technical parameter such as complexity, test coverage, clean code etc as columns and start populating matrix. Can be very useful for creating visuals for legacy codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toolkit&#34;&gt;Toolkit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our case we put products as rows grouped together with same product family (yellow stickies in picture)  and different processes steps followed for the product as columns (pink and blue stickies in picture - blue stickies are sub steps). .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used different colors and size of stickies to show products (yellow), process steps (pink &amp;amp; blue small) and how they differ from each other (orange small).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Project envisioning exercise - Term cloud</title>
        <link>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/9-term-cloud/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/9-term-cloud/</guid>
        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/9-term-cloud/ -&lt;p&gt;During inception one of the job of the inception team is to learn the terminology used by the business. Generally the board is put up with all the business buzzwords, terms that they use in their day to day job. We started doing that on one board called &amp;lsquo;Term Cloud&amp;rsquo;. Generally this board gets populated as side effect of all the games &amp;amp; exercise we do during inception also know as glossary, domain terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team came with an idea to play &amp;lsquo;term cloud&amp;rsquo; as one of the exercise during the inception in initial days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exercise-build-term-cloud&#34;&gt;Exercise: Build Term Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone speaks the same business terms including development team, SMEs and stakeholders. Helps with more collaborative communication during inception. Better domain understanding. Less confusions with buzzwords having same &amp;amp; different meanings.
&lt;strong&gt;When to play&lt;/strong&gt;: After a few sessions (preferably on the second day after you get a critical mass of terms)
&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;: 15-20 min
&lt;strong&gt;Participants&lt;/strong&gt;: Business SME&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; Stakeholders
&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;: Prepare board having &amp;lsquo;Term Cloud&amp;rsquo; written on it with few samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/9/term-cloud.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;term cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-execute&#34;&gt;How to execute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributes stickets to write buzzwords, jargons, terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember one term one sticky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give 5 min to write all the terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask participant to go in round robin fashion, explain the term and put it up on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put small sticky if that term requires explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If different terms has same meaning, club them together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If same terms has multiple meaning, come up with new term for less used meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/9/term-cloud-sample.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;term cloud sample&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;variations&#34;&gt;Variations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of everyone writing stickies, go in round robin and facilitator writes it on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Term Cloud board and keep populating as and when new terms pops up. (old style)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;toolkit&#34;&gt;Toolkit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following is the sample from the inception that we are going through. Yellow sticky is the term and Orange is used as note to explain the term.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Ruby vs Java vs .NET - How much does it matter on web projects?</title>
        <link>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/8-programming-language/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/8-programming-language/</guid>
        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/8-programming-language/ -&lt;p&gt;I was looking into some statistics on my multiple web project and found one very interesting stats on simple Lines of Code (LOC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/8/programming-language.png&#34; alt=&#34;code distribution metrics&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;* numbers are pure production code and does not include test code&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking at above metrics, I asked myself: during initial stage of the project, are we thinking enough about every part of the software and doing enough research around which language, technology &amp;amp; framework to use for project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most of the projects we just talk and talk about which language is the right choice (Java vs Ruby vs .NET vs &amp;hellip;) for your web application development. We are in so much rush to start that we don&amp;rsquo;t even have time to do enough study/spike on each technology decision and provide right technical solution to client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should I be thinking about, apart from core language and framework while deciding on architecture in initial stage of the project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand project and its components/parts during inception, discuss &amp;amp; make initial decision about choosing framework &amp;amp; library of different technologies. Make sure all components fit well with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt; JavaScript, HTML and CSS is big part of your web application code. Do not ignore that.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my application AJAX heavy? (page reload is kind of old fashioned now days). Choosing framework like angularjs, backbone.js, knockoutjs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does my application has image cropping or chart need. Should I do it in browser using JavaScript such as raphaeljs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out templating engine and its support e.g. mustache, haml and its port for specific language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how about using less or saas for CSS. This can help reducing your css effort significantly and more beautiful, concise, clean code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Store:&lt;/strong&gt; Which data store is the right choice for kind of data processed and maintained by application?
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choices are plenty now days, starting from traditional relational database, NoSQL databases (mongodb, riak, couchdb &amp;hellip;), graph database (neo4j), fast in-memory like databases (redis &amp;amp; memcached).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I leverage client side data store (browser datastore) for features like storing user preferences, session information etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate Product as a Service:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I leverage on PaaS for any feature in application?
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I need push notification service to serve dynamic content on my pages? checkout pubnub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is image processing such as resize and cropping is required for website? checkout services like lightspun and boxresizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go Could:&lt;/strong&gt; Discuss and make initial thoughts on production environment setup and deployment. This helps on setting up local env which can be as close as production env and other non production setup.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage could as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I need to provision env using Chef or Puppet? Can I use same for local env setting and using tools like vagrant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I use S3 with ColudFront to serve my static content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated testing:&lt;/strong&gt; how much and at which level? Decide on unit tests, integration tests and functional tests distribution. Make sure not to repeat same tests.  Follow software testing pyramid structure.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit can be at different levels
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;core programming level unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;javascript unit tests are important since most of the sites now days are javascript heavy.  Check out Jasmine for JavaScript unit testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;template level unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service level integration tests using your choice of unit testing framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;end2end functional tests, their are plenty of tools now days for browser functional testing. checkout phantomjs, tobi, cucumber, capybara and last but most popular selenium webdriver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest all that should continue such as choosing right technology with framework for server side development such as RoR or Java/Spring or Python/django etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy project envisioning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/7-amazon-s3-https/ -&lt;p&gt;On our site we have lots of images thumbnail getting served on HTTPS by Amazon S3. We were seeing very high load time in browsers upto 2-3 sec for approx 40-50KB size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried following load test on S3 and the results helped us making decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/7/amazon-s3-slow-with-https.png&#34; alt=&#34;amazon s3 performance issue with serving images over HTTPS&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serving S3 content over HTTPS is slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S3 performance is not effected (does not degred by # of objects in bucket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using CloudFront to serve S3 content over HTTPS gives significant improvement in time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>NoSQL learning &amp; gotchas based on MongoDB experience</title>
        <link>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/6-nosql-learnings/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/6-nosql-learnings/ -&lt;p&gt;I have been working on NoSQL database had some interesting learning on when not to use NoSQL database. All following learning are based on my NoSQL experience with mongoDB. This is an ongoing document which I am planning to keep updating as I keep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.sunitparekh.in/images/6/mongodb-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;mongodb&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-not-to-choose-nosql-database&#34;&gt;When NOT to choose NoSQL database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One primary gotcha of new technology is, when to use it by knowing when not to use it. Here is list of reasons, when you have to be careful choosing NoSQL,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your data is structured. Means your data follows predefined structure for all records like online web store, ticketing system etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your data has lots of relationships, including bidirectional like many to many etc. You need to carry references around in the dataset like customer has orders and order belongs to customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need lots of indexes on a document. You need search your document by multiple search criteria, means either your data is structured or multiple document stored as single document in database. Need to revisit your document design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction is important. need to update multiple dataset and it should either all succeed or fail like financial transaction of transfer from one account to another and required multiple data updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nosql-gotchas&#34;&gt;NoSQL gotchas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you choose NoSQL don&amp;rsquo;t fall into trap of designing and applying SQL best practices to NoSQL. Here is few example where SQL and NoSQL database differs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not assume your query is successful if it returns successfully. MongoDB query returns immediately and queues up queries on server for execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not good practice to let your document grow over time.  MongoDB stores document in sequential manner without much buffer, assuming the document doesn&amp;rsquo;t grow over a period of time. And if you add more content in your document it has to move your whole document in new place. Trick is to create document with full content and default values OR adding some temp content while creating and removing it immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexes are more costly in NoSQL than standard SQL database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Design for feature and code for story</title>
        <link>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/5-design-for-feature/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>//www.sunitparekh.in/posts/5-design-for-feature/</guid>
        <description>sUnit Blog //www.sunitparekh.in/posts/5-design-for-feature/ -&lt;p&gt;I have been practicing agile development engineering practices for almost more than 4 yrs now. One of practice about agile development is it talks about &amp;lsquo;code for story&amp;rsquo;, which means you just do simple enough implementation required for the story. Why? because you don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s required in future and will remain as it is or change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now considering &amp;lsquo;code for story&amp;rsquo; practice, this is what happens on the ground. Pair picks up a first story of a feature and &amp;lsquo;just did what was required for the story to implement&amp;rsquo;, after few days another pair picks up a story on same feature and says &amp;lsquo;Ohh&amp;hellip; I have to first refactor the code so that it can be extended to implement next story&amp;rsquo;, which means the work done by first story is partially or fully refactored. Fine, but similar approach continues as we keep picking up subsequent stories and Project Manager freaks out saying &amp;lsquo;Refactoring is good, but when it required for every story that we implement is not just right OR something wrong with my understanding of refactoring.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take a very trivial example to explain above scenario. For the first story, I just used simple member variable since that story deals with only one item,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    String department&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;next story extends the feature by changing simple member variable to List of objects which means changing all signatures and yes changing all tests as part of refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    List&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Department&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; departments&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now next story requires extending the feature again with changing List to Map and again same refactoring but more tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    Map&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;string&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Department&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; departments&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we end up refactoring (throwing away) work done in previous stories. This scenario happens quite lot of time on projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can avoid such scenarios on project by redefining a practice as &amp;lsquo;Design for Feature and Code for Story&amp;rsquo;. Which means when I am working on any story I keep in mind the all feature stories and design my application to cater for feature while making sure I just code what is required for the story in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developers and business analyst needs to make sure developers implementing the story has enough context about feature and understands the story scope within feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leads on the project to participate in discussion during first few stories of the feature development, call huddles initially to gather different ideas in designing for feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might be that your first few stories takes little extra time that just doing simple way, however make sure to weight that extra time &amp;amp; effort vs. benefits in future story implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing high level design early in cycle helps in faster development due to reduced rework and less throw away on project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Out and avoid following when you &amp;lsquo;Design for Feature and Code for Story&amp;rsquo;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing low-level design and putting lots of effort in just design. Going into mode of &amp;lsquo;upfront low level design for feature&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not implement or start writing code for future stories. It&amp;rsquo;s okay if your future stories may take just few hours, don&amp;rsquo;t do it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design for Feature doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you freeze it once decided. Let design still evolve as you keep implementing stories of the feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
