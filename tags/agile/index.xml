      <description>On large teams it is very important that everyone understands and follow the same branching model/workflow. One of very popular branching workflow is GitFlow, however with distributed and novice team following GitFlow is difficult. So over a period of time I have been following simple 3 branch model for development which works fine for agile and continuous delivery software development method.
3 Branch workflow model    Challenges with following GitFlow on large distributed teams  Team to be at advance level of using Git version control with good hold on branching, merging techniques.</description>

      <description>Testing is key activity of every software development projects. However testing certain features is not easy and need special support functions. One of such functionality is email testing. In this article I introduce few tools that I used in my projects for achieving email testing easily without any side effects.
