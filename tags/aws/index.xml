      <description>On our site we have lots of images thumbnail getting served on HTTPS by Amazon S3. We were seeing very high load time in browsers upto 2-3 sec for approx 40-50KB size.

Conclusion:  Serving S3 content over HTTPS is slow S3 performance is not effected (does not degred by # of objects in bucket Using CloudFront to serve S3 content over HTTPS gives significant improvement in time  </description>
