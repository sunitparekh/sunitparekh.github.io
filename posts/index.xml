      <description>On large teams it is very important that everyone understands and follow the same branching model/workflow. One of very popular branching workflow is GitFlow, however with distributed and novice team following GitFlow is difficult. So over a period of time I have been following simple 3 branch model for development which works fine for agile and continuous delivery software development method.
3 Branch workflow model    Challenges with following GitFlow on large distributed teams  Team to be at advance level of using Git version control with good hold on branching, merging techniques.</description>

      <description>What should be the Sprint duration? this question comes up quite commonly on agile projects and opinions vary from as short as a week to as long as 6 weeks. Decision on an appropriate Sprint length depend on many factors. Few of the factors that I consider while deciding on the Sprint length are as follows, however, each factor adds different dimensions when the team is distributed across time zones.</description>

      <title>Ownership model for distributed team</title>

      <description>Setting up distributed team is very common in new world of software development. However, it is equally important that each team operates in complete autonomy and there is a need for teams to be independent, taking ownership and deliver. However, everyone has different views and understanding of ownership. I would like to take this opportunity to explain my view on different aspects of ownership which can help stakeholders and team in having common understanding of expectations and help deliver with ownership and accountability.</description>

      <description>Testing is key activity of every software development projects. However testing certain features is not easy and need special support functions. One of such functionality is email testing. In this article I introduce few tools that I used in my projects for achieving email testing easily without any side effects.
To test emails effectively we end up using real email addresses, which leads to cluttering mailbox with unwanted emails. For testing different scenarios we need multiple email address, and testing becomes more difficult when it requires checking mailbox of other users.</description>

      <description>In my interactions with people, I hear &amp;ldquo;Agile and Continuous Delivery works for new green field projects, but we have legacy project. We don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start or we can&amp;rsquo;t do agile and continuous delivery on our project&amp;rdquo;.
Most of the time legacy projects are facing typical issues like fragile codebase, too much technical debt, old libraries &amp;amp; frameworks. Which resulting into long development and testing cycles. To solve these problems, team decides to follow Agile practices.</description>

      <title>Use structured logging for log search and analytics</title>

      <guid>http://sunitparekh.in/posts/22-structured-logging/</guid>
      <description>Logging is followed in almost every project. However, most of the time we end up using logs only for debugging and auditing purpose. Since past few projects we have been exploring more opportunities for leveraging logs for purposes like application metrics collection, reporting, monitoring and alerting. And during this, I learnt about structured logging and how it enables us to achieve lot more using logs.
Lets first look at what we need to follow while logging to achieve structured logging.</description>

      <title>Zero downtime using blue-green deployment strategy</title>

      <description>Zero downtime during application deployment is one of the key requirements for continuos delivery. And no business would like their site to be down and showing maintenance page every few days/weeks during deployment.
To achieve this we decide to go for blue-green deployment. However, we were challenged with how to do this in legacy style data center infrastructure where we are,
 Not able to spin new machines and throw away old machines automatically using scripts Don&amp;rsquo;t have ability to add/remove instances using scripts from load-balancer Network level configurations are done manually like firewall setting  Also keeping full in-active stack didn&amp;rsquo;t sound good idea.</description>

      <description>I have been working on web application development since last 12+ years and had privileged to work on more than 20+ different project. Now days the expectations from web apps are totally different than it was few years back. End users are provided with rich content on single page (Amazon, CNN, &amp;hellip;). On a single page, lots of data needs to be mashed up and data may come from different sources.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always been difficult to identify and easy to miss-out on creating stories for cross functional requirement (XFR) a.k.a NonFunctional requirements (NFR) during inception. Inception is a short, time boxed, 2-3 weeks initial requirement gathering phase of the software development project lifecycle. I have been to multiple inception and figured out a nice and collaborating way of capturing and converting cross functional requirements into stories. We run it like a workshops, collaborating with client to identify and capture XFRs.</description>

      <description>Lots of time when I discuss Responsive Web Design (RWD), sometime I find out that we don&amp;rsquo;t know the problem, we are trying to solve with RWD. And the objective of this blog post is look into the history and learn what problem we try to solve with RWD.
The multiple screen resolution problem is not new, even in old days the monitors had different screen resolution. The problem exist from old days.</description>

      <title>Data Anonymization techniques, Blacklist and Whitelist?</title>

      <description>Continuation of my previous post about the need for anonymized production data dump, here is more details on two anonymization approaches blacklist and whitelist. Lets take one simple example and understand both the approaches. Consider two tables of database: Customers and Config.
Blacklist This approach essentially leaves all fields unchanged with the exception of those specified by the user, which are scrambled/anonymized (hence the name Blacklist!). For Blacklist, create a copy of the prod database and choose the fields to be anonymized e.</description>

      <description>On one of my previous projects, we wrote a jMeter performance test suite, which runs periodically on performance environment. Once the application was in production, we enhanced our performance test suite based on actual user behaviours from Apache access logs and Omniture analytics. That provided us a great level of confidence in development for scaling. Now the next step was to get the production dataset so our performance testing becomes almost like production peak load.</description>

      <description>Now days it&amp;rsquo;s kind of defacto that every website requires some sort of mechanism to update changes dynamically. On my last project we had a specific need to keep updating the count of messages like Facebook does for unread messages. The website is a dot com site with reasonable user base online. It was challenging to come up with a solution so that we can get this developed quickly and scale well with the load.</description>

      <description>Agile software development is getting more and more attention now a days. One of the variations of it is called &amp;lsquo;Distributed Agile Development&amp;rsquo;. And a key ingredient for distributed teams to work effectively is &amp;ldquo;communication&amp;rdquo;. Quote from Kent Back on communication &amp;ldquo;Problems with projects can invariably be traced back to somebody not talking to somebody else about something important.&amp;rdquo;
Currently we are doing an inception with a client and their past experience with distributed team has left them with some bitterness.</description>

      <title>Project envisioning exercise - Process Timeline Map</title>

      <guid>http://sunitparekh.in/posts/11-process-timeline-map/</guid>
      <description>One of the key challenges in an inception is to learn about the business processes and its workflow in a fair amount of detail in a relatively quick amount of time. The idea is, not to just learn about the client&amp;rsquo;s business processes, but also to ensure that various stakeholders within the client actually share that understanding instead of having varying ideas in their own heads.
There are plenty of methods to study business processes but they are time consuming and heavy weight and may be not as collaborative.</description>

      <description>One of the key factors for our project is that the client is almost 80+ yrs old in business. There are multiple products with different variations of it in the market. Now one of the task/session was to understand their product space, their groupings and how they differ from each other.
For understanding product and its family and how they differ from each other, we (Inception team - Sunit, Amit, Panda and Birinder) came up with a simple idea of creating a &amp;ldquo;Product Map&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>During inception one of the job of the inception team is to learn the terminology used by the business. Generally the board is put up with all the business buzzwords, terms that they use in their day to day job. We started doing that on one board called &amp;lsquo;Term Cloud&amp;rsquo;. Generally this board gets populated as side effect of all the games &amp;amp; exercise we do during inception also know as glossary, domain terms.</description>

      <title>Design for feature and code for story</title>
      <link>http://sunitparekh.in/posts/5-design-for-feature/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://sunitparekh.in/posts/5-design-for-feature/</guid>
      <description>I have been practicing agile development engineering practices for almost more than 4 yrs now. One of practice about agile development is it talks about &amp;lsquo;code for story&amp;rsquo;, which means you just do simple enough implementation required for the story. Why? because you don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s required in future and will remain as it is or change.
Now considering &amp;lsquo;code for story&amp;rsquo; practice, this is what happens on the ground. Pair picks up a first story of a feature and &amp;lsquo;just did what was required for the story to implement&amp;rsquo;, after few days another pair picks up a story on same feature and says &amp;lsquo;Ohh&amp;hellip; I have to first refactor the code so that it can be extended to implement next story&amp;rsquo;, which means the work done by first story is partially or fully refactored.</description>
